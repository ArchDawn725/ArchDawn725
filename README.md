# 👋 Hi, I'm ArchDawn (Chesney Gunnells)

**Unity/C# Game Programmer • Systems & Architecture Specialist • 7+ Years Experience**

I’ve been developing games since 2018, creating systems, tools, and full games as both a solo developer and collaborator.  
My work spans published titles, multiplayer frameworks, turn-based combat systems, procedural generation, and scalable architecture.

## 🧩 What I Do

- 🎮 **Gameplay Programming** — combat loops, progression, roguelites, VR interactions  
- 🏗️ **Systems Architecture** — scalable, modular, data-driven game systems  
- 🧠 **AI Design** — state machines, behavior logic, enemy control, decision systems  
- 🛠️ **Tools & Pipelines** — custom inspectors, modding systems, automation tools  
- 🚀 **Optimization & Profiling** — allocations, pooling, async workflows, GC control  
- 🌐 **Multiplayer** — lobbies, 9-player match support, networked turn-based systems  

_All code in my portfolio repositories is written by me._

## 🧠 How I Work

- I value **expandability and optimization** as core pillars of clean architecture.  
- Systems should scale without rewriting.  
- Tools should empower designers and players.  
- Code should be readable, predictable, and maintainable.  
- I’m committed to continuous improvement and solving complex technical problems.
