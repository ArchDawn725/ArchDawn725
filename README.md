# 👋 Hi, I'm ArchDawn

Unity / C# Game Programmer • Systems & Architecture Focus • 2018–Present

I build games and gameplay systems in Unity + C#, from solo projects to published titles and collaborations.  
This portfolio shows my multi-year growth from early small projects to large, system-heavy games.

---

## 🧩 What I Do

- 🎮 Gameplay & Systems Programming – combat loops, progression, UI flows, metagame systems  
- 🏗️ Architecture & Code Design – modular systems, clean patterns, maintainable codebases  
- 🛠️ Tools & Editor Extensions – custom inspectors, workflows, and pipelines for designers  
- 🚀 Optimization & Debugging – profiling, allocations, performance bottlenecks, refactors  

_All code in my portfolio repos is written by me unless explicitly noted._

## 🛠️ Tech & Skills

Languages: C#, (optionally: C, C++, etc.)  
Engine: Unity (2D/3D, URP, prefabs, scenes, ScriptableObjects, etc.)  
Core Skills:
- Game & systems architecture  
- Data-driven design (ScriptableObjects / config assets)  
- State machines, event systems, managers  
- Save/load systems, scene flow, game loops  
- Performance profiling & optimization (GC, allocations, caching)  
- Version control (Git)

## 📈 Growth Timeline

I’ve been developing games and systems for several years. This portfolio is organized to show that progression:

- **2018–2020 – Learning & Tutorials**  
  Getting comfortable with Unity, C#, and core game dev concepts.

- **2020 – First Complete Prototypes**  
  _Dispatch Disaster_ – early attempts at game architecture and full loops.

- **2021 – First Large Published Game**  
  _Unchosen: Forsaken_ – full game structure, content pipeline, and release.

- **2023–2024 – Multiple Large Projects**  
  _Clay Soldiers_, _Urban Entrepreneur_, _Talking Coin_ – stronger architecture, tools, and optimization.

- **2025 – Modern Systems & Collaboration**  
  _Battle Tokens_ and the _Tulsa collaboration_ – focus on scalability, cleaner patterns, and team workflows.

## 🧠 How I Work

- I like **clear, modular systems** with well-defined responsibilities.  
- I write code with **future maintainers in mind**, not just to “make it work.”  
- I use **profiling and iteration** to keep performance in check.  
- I’m comfortable working **solo or in a team**, giving and receiving code reviews.
